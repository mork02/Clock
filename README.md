# Clock!

This is the first version of my own **Clock app**.  
I needed a simple clock on my PC, so I created one to **measure programming sessions** and keep track of time.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0, WPF

## Motivation
As a software developer, I often lose track of time while coding.  
This small console project helps me monitor my work sessions and serves as a personal **C# showcase**.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeDeX/Clock.git
   cd Clock
   ```
2. Build & run:
	```bash
	dotnet run
	```
