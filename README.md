# Clock!

This is the first version of my own Clock app.
It’s finished for now, but there’s still a lot that could be added when I find the time.
I don’t plan to stay too long on this project, as I want to move on to building bigger ones.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 8.0, WPF

## Motivation
As a software developer, I often lose track of time while coding.
This small console project helps me monitor my work sessions and serves as a personal C# showcase.

How to Run

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KeDeX/Clock.git
